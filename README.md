# final_project_coursera
This capstone project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The
goal of the project is to demonstrate proficiency in data science and machine
learning techniques using a real-world data and to summarize the results in a
report.
In this project, a rival company to SpaceX (i.e., SpaceY) uses SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket
data to determine the rocket first stage landing successes and also uses the rocket
data to determine the cost of a launch. Space Y uses the data to bid against SpaceX
for a rocket launch. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launch cost to be 62 million
dollars.
Whereas for other companies the cost of a rocket launch is more than 165 million
dollars. Throughout the project Python Jupyter note books are used to perform the
data collection and analysis. These Jupyter note books and the final *.pdf report are
saved in my GitHub repository webpage.
The major parts of this report include data collection methodology, data wrangling,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive data visualization, machine learning
(ML) classification model development, and model evaluation. Finally, the accuracy
of different ML algorithms are compared in predicting the future landing of the
Falcon 9 first stage rocket.
